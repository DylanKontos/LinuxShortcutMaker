Welcome to the Linux (Debian 12) Shortcut Creator.

This program will ensure your program/package/application has:
- A desktop shortcut
- Appears on your dashboard desktop environment

This program is written in C# and when built, creates a natively executable filetype for Linux (run like so: ./Shortcutter).
So no .dll file and no requirement for dotnet installation.

Q. Why not Shell or Python?
A. See above.

Manual steps this program solves:
- Creating a .desktop file for an app/program
- Copying .desktop file to ~/.local/share/applications to ensure it appears in dashboard
- Validating the file and checking for errors
